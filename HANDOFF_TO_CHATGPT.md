## üîê Environment Variables

These are configured in `.env` (not committed to git):

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.vvmlgbwtaavrkvygazgm:Danielson72@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://beatslave.netlify.app
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://beatslave.netlify.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=generate_with_openssl_rand_base64_32
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

RESEND_FROM=BeatSlave <onboarding@resend.dev>

```

**Note:** You'll need to set these in Netlify's environment variables dashboard.

## üîÑ How the System Works

### **Purchase Flow**
1. Customer selects a track and clicks "Buy Now"
2. Frontend calls `POST /api/checkout` with track ID and email
3. Backend creates order in database (status: PENDING)
4. Backend creates Stripe checkout session
5. Customer is redirected to Stripe to complete payment
6. After payment, Stripe sends webhook to `POST /api/webhooks/stripe`
7. Backend updates order to COMPLETED
8. Backend generates 24-hour download token
9. Backend sends two emails:
   - Purchase confirmation to customer (with download link)
   - Admin notification to `dalvarez@sotsvc.com`
10. Customer clicks download link in email
11. Frontend calls `GET /api/download/[token]`
12. Backend validates token and serves the audio file
13. Token is marked as used

### **Admin Flow**
1. Admin logs into `/admin` page with password
2. Admin can create tracks via UI (currently UI-only, needs API integration)
3. Admin can call API endpoints directly with Bearer token:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD" \
     https://beatslave.netlify.app/api/admin/analytics
   ```

## üí° Quick Tips

### **Database Queries**
```typescript
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma";

// Get all tracks
const tracks = await prisma.track.findMany({
  where: { isActive: true },
  include: { release: { include: { artist: true } } }
});
```

### **Sending Emails**
```typescript
import { sendPurchaseConfirmation } from "@/lib/email-service";

await sendPurchaseConfirmation({
  customerEmail: "customer@example.com",
  trackTitle: "Beat Name",
  artistName: "Producer Name",
  licenseType: "STANDARD",
  priceCents: 99,
  downloadToken: "uuid-token",
  orderId: "order-id"
});
```

### **Admin Authentication**
```typescript
function verifyAdminAuth(req: NextRequest): boolean {
  const authHeader = req.headers.get("authorization");
  const adminPassword = process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD;
  
  if (!authHeader || !authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
    return false;
  }
  
  const token = authHeader.substring(7);
  return token === adminPassword;
}
```

### **Testing Stripe Locally**
```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Login
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to local server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

# Trigger test event
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Emails not sending**
