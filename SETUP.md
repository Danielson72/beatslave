## ðŸš¦ Next Steps to Go Live

### 1. Configure Stripe (Required)

Get your Stripe API keys from https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys

Update `.env.local`:
```env
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_51..."
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_51..."
```

### 2. Set Up Stripe Webhooks (Required)

**For Development:**
```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Login to Stripe
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to local server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

Copy the webhook signing secret (starts with `whsec_`) and add to `.env.local`:
```env
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
```

**For Production:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select event: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Copy webhook signing secret to production environment

### 3. Upload Track Files (Required)

Place actual audio files in these directories:
- `/public/uploads/covers/` - Cover artwork (JPG/PNG)
- `/public/uploads/tracks/` - Full tracks (WAV format)
- `/public/uploads/previews/` - 30-second previews (MP3 format)

Update the database records to point to the correct file paths.

### 4. Test the Purchase Flow

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Browse to http://localhost:3000/catalog
3. Click on any track
4. Enter email and accept terms
